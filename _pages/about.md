I am a robotics researcher working in the areas of spatial intelligence and generative learning. My research aims to build _general_ robot agents which are capable of tackling complex tasks across diverse environments, with an emphasis on understanding the structure, dynamics and constraints of the real world.

Currently, I'm working with [Dr Charu Sharma](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/Charusharma/) at [Machine Learning Lab](https://mll.iiit.ac.in/), IIIT Hyderabad. Previously, I was an MS by Research student at [Robotics Research Center](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/) advised by [Prof Madhava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/) . I did my Bachelor's degree at Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani ([BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/)).     

**Currently looking for PhD positions!** Please find my [CV here](https://saishubodh.notion.site/Resume-Curriculum-Vitae-Shubodh-Sai-Oct-2024-119874ed2adf801d93f8fb3779b7d06d?pvs=4).

I find my creative expression through playing Tennis or writing poetry, or dreaming while lost in a sci-fi novel -- articulated as _"art, sport, music and a good life"_. Take a glance at [Gallery](/blog/2024/life-gallery/) and more at [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shubodhs.ai/)!     

I love to teach and believe one way of pushing the frontiers of research is through _imaginative_ teaching! For updates on such exciting projects, follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shubodhs_ai) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/shubodhs-ai.bsky.social).
