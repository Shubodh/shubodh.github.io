Currently building something new in robot learning.

I am a researcher in robot learning. My research aims to build _general-purpose_ robot agents which are capable of taking a complex set of actions across diverse environments, while understanding the structure, dynamics and constraints of the real world. I have also worked on "AI for Science" research.

Previously, I've worked with [Dr Charu Sharma](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/Charusharma/) at [Machine Learning Lab](https://mll.iiit.ac.in/) and [Prof Madhava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/) as an MS by Research student at [Robotics Research Center](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/). I did my Bachelor's degree at Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani ([BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/)).

I find my creative expression through playing Tennis or writing poetry, or dreaming while lost in a sci-fi novel -- articulated as _"art, sport, music and a good life"_. Take a glance at [Gallery](/blog/2024/life-gallery/) and more at [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shubodhs.ai/)!
