This resource is a series of detailed notes on mobile robotics concepts. The content is organized under three main umbrella topics: **Geometric Transformations and Mapping**, **Optimization Techniques in Robotics**, and **Visual Perception and Camera Calibration**. Each of these sections is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding from basic principles to implementations, supported by visually appealing aesthetic content along with a modern interactive user interface in Notion. This is a perfect tradeoff between lecture slides and a textbook, providing the best of both worlds.

1. **Geometric Transformations and Mapping**: This section delves into the essentials of spatial transformations and different data representations crucial for robotics navigation and mapping. It covers point cloud registration, including the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method, which is pivotal for 3D reconstruction and alignment tasks.
2. **Optimization Techniques in Robotics**: Focusing on linear and non-linear optimization problems, this section discusses their applications in vision and robotics. It includes a detailed look at how pose graph SLAM is formulated as a least squares optimization problem and explores the foundations of pose graph SLAM with practical examples.
3. **Visual Perception and Camera Calibration**: This part introduces projective and epipolar geometry to explain how robots perceive depth and distance. Topics such as triangulation, Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problems, and structure from motion are discussed, which are fundamental for understanding how robots and autonomous systems interpret visual information.



This started off as lecture notes for flagship course "Mobile Robotics" offered by RRC, IIIT-Hyderabad in 2020 and now can be used as a reference for any student interested in these concepts. This is the first time that a course has been designed in Notion (at least at an Indian university), and it has been a great success. This resource has organically attracted students for 4+ years (as of 2024)!
